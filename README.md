[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lsst-sqre/ci-scripts.png)](https://travis-ci.org/lsst-sqre/ci-scripts)

This repo began as an import of the state of lsst-dev:/home/buildbot/RHEL6/scripts
as of 2015-03-17.  These scripts were invoked by the buildbot worker that
was running on lsst-dev; they are now invoked by Jenkins agents.

The scripts appear to have been historically tracked by the
[`lsst/buildbot`](https://github.com/lsst/buildbot/tree/master/scripts)
repo.  However, they have been purged from `lsst/buildbot` and this repo
should now be considered authoritative.
